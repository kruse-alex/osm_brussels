# Workshop on Open Bike Data & Mapping
This Repo contains the slides as well as the R script and data for my workshop on bike sharing usage for the [full-day event on open bike data and maps](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-bike-data-mapping-with-openstreetmap-registration-34806438996) on the 21st of July 2017 in Brussels.

Here is a screenshot from the Brussels bike sharing usage map with FAKE DATA from Villo! The participants going to learn how to create this interactive map during my workshop. I took the locations information on the Villo! stations from [here](https://opendata.brussels.be/explore/dataset/villo-stations-availability-in-real-time/) and simulated some FAKE USAGE DATA. You can also find the R script to generate the FAKE USAGE DATA in this Repo.
